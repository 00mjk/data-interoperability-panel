# Resource Metadata in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel).

## Goal

The aim of this project is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a mechanism for how metadata (such as access control or shape constraints) is associated and accessed for a given resource.
