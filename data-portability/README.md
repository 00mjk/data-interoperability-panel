# Data Portability in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel). See the [original project proposal](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/6).

## Goal

The aim of this project is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a mechanism for how one migrates their data, including the "meta" information around it (i.e. access control, audit history, shape constraints) from one Solid pod to another, or from one Solid pod to a different medium altogether.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
