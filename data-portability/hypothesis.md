# Hypothesis for Implementing Data Portability

This document details a hypothesis for how one migrates their data from one Solid pod to another, or from one Solid pod to a different medium altogether, to satisfy the stated [use cases](use-cases.md).

This hypothesis will be validated and refined through critical review and prototyping, with the end result being input into a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification).
