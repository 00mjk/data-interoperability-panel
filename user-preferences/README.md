# User Preferences - Solid Data Model

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel).

## Goal

In the app-centric world, user preferences are something that are very tightly bound to the application. In a decentralized Solid world, user preferences become much more powerful, and can be applied across applications at various levels.

For example, in addition to the traditional application specific preferences, a user can have preferences that apply globally across all applications, like their language and locale. They can have preferences that apply only to certain types of things, like preferring images not to be expanded inline in chat sessions within any application. They can also set preferences around a specific instance of a thing, like turning off notifications for a particular chat.

Because preferences are so pervasive in Solid, it is critical to agree on the model we use to represent them.

Consequently, the aim of this project is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a standard data model for User Preferences in Solid.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Create and refine the user preferences model
3. Create shape schemas for the user preferences model
3. Demonstrate use of the model in a working prototype
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification)
