Abstract:
  A proposal for a Solid ecosystem that supports data interoperability across
  applications while enabling secure collaboration and query using intuitive
  data boundaries without changing the fundamentals of Solid, presented in the
  form of an end-to-end use case.

Problems {#problems}
=====================

Solid affords us the opportunity to create a valuable and
powerful ecosystem where people and organizations retain control of their data,
but are also able to put it to work and use it to its full potential. The
fundamentals of Solid make this possible, but further definition of standard
methods and mechanisms must be established to make it practical, intuitive, and
secure.

* [Problem #1](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-1---disparate-applications-cannot-practically-interoperate-over-the-same-data-safely-and-effectively) -
    Disparate applications cannot practically interoperate over the same data
    safely and effectively.
* [Problem #2](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-2---people-must-be-able-to-understand-what-data-they-have-to-effectively-use-it-or-share-it-safely) -
    People must be able to understand what data they have to effectively use it
    or share it safely.
* [Problem #3](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-3---disparate-entities-using-different-applications-must-be-able-to-safely-and-effectively-interoperate-within-their-scope-of-authorization) -
    Disparate entities using different applications must be able to
    safely and effectively interoperate within their scope of authorization.
* [Problem #4](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-4---people-shouldnt-need-to-think-about-how-to-physically-organize-their-data-to-use-solid) -
    People shouldnâ€™t need to think about how to physically organize
    their data to use Solid.
* [Problem #5](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-5---when-data-is-stored-and-secure-it-should-be-queryable-using-any-mechanism-and-able-to-be-requested-in-different-representations) -
    When data is stored and secure, it should be queryable using any
    mechanism, and able to be requested in different representations.
* [Problem #6](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#problem-6---these-problems-must-be-solvable-using-the-fundamentals-of-solid-as-it-exists-today) -
    These problems must be solvable using the fundamentals of Solid
    as it exists today.

Note: See [[PROBLEMS-AND-GOALS]] for a detailed explanation of each discrete
problem.

Goals {#goals}
=====================

We must be able to support data interoperability across applications while
enabling secure collaboration and query using intuitive data boundaries.

Diversity in how the same data will be accessed and manipulated by different
entities and applications exacerbates the need for reliable mechanisms that
protect against data corruption, data leakage, or broken workflows

Standard methods and mechanisms for interoperability, collaboration, and
security of data in a Solid Pod must realize these needs, and it must be done
without changing the fundamentals of Solid.

* [Goal #1](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-1---seamless-data-interoperability-across-disparate-applications) -
    Seamless data interoperability across disparate applications.
* [Goal #2](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-2---use-intuitive-data-boundaries-to-provide-human-to-machine-interoperability) -
    Use intuitive data boundaries to provide human to machine interoperability.
* [Goal #3](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-3---secure-collaboration-over-intuitive-data-boundaries) -
    Secure collaboration over intuitive data boundaries.
* [Goal #4](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-4---standard-and-flexible-organizing-model-for-data) -
    Standard and flexible organizing model for data.
* [Goal #5](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-5---flexibility-and-support-for-different-and-evolving-query-mechanisms) -
    Flexibility and support for different and evolving query mechanisms.
* [Goal #6](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/problems-and-goals.md#goal-6---optimize-and-extend-but-do-not-change-solid-fundamentals) -
    Optimize and extend, but do not change Solid fundamentals.

Note: See [[PROBLEMS-AND-GOALS]] for a detailed explanation of each discrete
goal.
