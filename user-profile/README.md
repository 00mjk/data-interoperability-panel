# User Profile - Solid Data Model

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel). See the [original project proposal](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/5).

## Goal

The User Profile, starting at the top level WebID Profile document, is the gateway through which an application can determine where a user keeps their things, and the preferences associated with how those things should be accessed and manipulated.

To date, there has not been enough critical review of the required contents of the profile document. From privacy and security concerns to [Data Discovery](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/data-discovery) and [User Preferences](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/user-preferences), it is imperative that we standardize on the key elements of the User Profile.

The aim of this project is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a standard data model for a User Profile in Solid.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Create and refine the user profile model
3. Create shape schemas for the user profile model
3. Demonstrate use of the model in a working prototype
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification).
