# Use Cases for the User Profile

The following use cases must be considered when designing the data model for the Solid User Profile.

### Job Applications
The User Profile should support storing education and certification information, employment history information, and standard demographic information. This will allow for the development of Solid compatible job application sites (e.g. Monster, Indeed, Glassdoor etc).

### Resume Builders
The User Profile should support storing education and certification information, employment history information, and standard demographic information. This will allow for the development of Solid compatible resume building applications and sites (e.g. Zety, Indeed, Resume Genius).

### Calendar Applications
The User Profile should support storing event data (start time/date, end time/date, description, attendees, location, etc) to allow the development of Solid compatible calendar and other productivity applications and sites.

### Message Applications
The User Profile should support storing message information. This would allow for the development of Solid compatible chat applications, email-like applications and support for direct messaging in social apps.

### Car Insurance Applications
The User Profile should support storing automobile ownership information in addition to standard demogrpahic information. This will allow for the development of Solid compatible automobile insurance quote applications.

### Apartment Rental Applications
The User Profile should support storing information regarding where a user lives and where they have previously lived. This would allow for the development of Solid compatible applications and sites for apartment rental applications (e.g Zillow).

### Loan Applications
The User Profile should support storing financial information regarding user income and expenses. This would allow for the development of Solid compatible applications and sites for applying for bank loans.
