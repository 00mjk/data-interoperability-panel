# Use Cases for Data Discovery

The following use cases must be considered when designing a mechanism for a data pod to define how its data is stored and indexed so that a given application can automatically find the data that it needs.

## Introduction

_TODO - Add introduction section_

## Problem Cases

The following use cases detail some of the problems related to a Solid ecosystem without Data Discovery.

__An example of total failure without data discovery.__
1. A user interacts with an application to do the first thing.
1. The application then goes and does the second thing.
1. There is no discovery, which makes the third thing a complete failure.
1. Everyone loses, sadness ensues.
