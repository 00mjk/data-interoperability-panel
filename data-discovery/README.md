# Data Discovery in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel). See the [original project proposal](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/2).

## Goal

The aim of this is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a mechanism for a data pod to define how its data is stored and indexed so that a given application can automatically find the data that it needs.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
