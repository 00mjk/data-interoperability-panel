# Hypothesis for Implementing Data Discovery

This document details a hypothesis for a data pod to define how its data is stored and indexed, so that a given application can automatically find the data that it needs. It takes into account the stated [use cases](use-cases.md).

This hypothesis will be validated and refined through critical review and prototyping, with the end result being input into a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification).
