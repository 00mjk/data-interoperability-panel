[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel](https://badges.gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel.svg)](https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Focused on ensuring the seamless and safe interoperability of data as
it is read and written by different users and/or applications.

Areas of interest include vocabularies, shapes, footprints, indexes,
and the mechanisms through which these things (and others) work together
to achieve interoperability.
