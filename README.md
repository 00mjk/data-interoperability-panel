# Solid Data Interoperability Panel

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel](https://badges.gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel.svg)](https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Focus

We must be able to support data interoperability across applications while enabling secure collaboration and query using intuitive data boundaries.

Diversity in how the same data will be accessed and manipulated by different entities and applications exacerbates the need for reliable mechanisms that protect against data corruption, data leakage, or broken workflows

Standard methods and mechanisms for interoperability, collaboration, and security of data in a Solid Pod must realize these needs, and it must be done without changing the fundamentals of Solid.

Read our stated [Problems and Goals](problems-and-goals.md) for an in-depth understanding of the panel's focus.

## Completed Work

[Resource Metadata](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/tree/master/archive/resource-metadata) - Resource Metadata was [submitted](solid/specification#156) as a candidate proposal to the solid/specification. It was renamed to Auxiliary Resources during Editorial Review.

## Meetings

Panel meetings are held most Mondays at 3:30PM EST / 8:30PM BST / 9:30PM CEST. Check-in on [gitter](https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel) for weekly agenda. Minutes are posted below.

## Process

Project proposals must be [submitted as issues](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/new), and receive support from members of the panel. At least three panelists (not including the panelist proposing the project) must support creation of the project, with no panel members actively rejecting it. Project proposals with support will be undertaken by the panel.

Substantive changes submitted to active panel projects should be submitted as pull requests, and must receive at least two approved reviews from panelists, with no one actively rejecting. These pulls should be open for at least one week before they are merged.

Panel members should work together to settle deadlocks. It may be helpful to request the perspective of a Solid Editor that would ultimately be responsible for accepting submitted candidate proposals to settle deadlocks.
