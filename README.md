# Solid Data Interoperability Panel

Focused on ensuring the seamless and safe interoperability of data as
it is read and written by different users and/or applications.

Areas of interest include vocabularies, shapes, footprints, indexes,
and the mechanisms through which these things (and others) work together
to achieve interoperability.

For contributing members see the
